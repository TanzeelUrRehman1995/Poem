        <h1>A Woke Mind</h1>
        <p id="peom-para"> Though I am not one of a kind <br>
            But, I indeed have a woke mind, <br>
            For years I have been woken, and about it I have spoken <br>
            And souls like me are not that hard to find. <br> <br>
            
            I read books and I don't ever burn them <br>
            Not even in violence or for a whim, <br>
            If I don't like the book, I don't give it a second look <br>
            Book reading is knowledge prelim. <br>
            
            I always embrace science <br>
            With unto me you will find no defiance, <br>
            God is the greatest scientist, because of him all does exist <br>
            And that gives me my reliance. <br> <br>
            
            When new information ever becomes available <br>
            When it's placed for me on the table, <br>
            My mind I'm willing to change, to it I'm not estrange <br>
            Into facts I'm always salable. <br> <br>
            
            I understand that most issues are not black and white <br>
            I also know that wrong is never right, <br>
            And the color of the skin, doesn't give you a loss or a win <br>
            For that fact I'm willing to fight. <br> <br>
            
            I believe in true equality for one and all <br>
            Whether your name is Jose', Juan, Aaron, Amari or Paul, <br>
            We all have the right to live, the right to help and give <br>
            None of us should be refused by a wall. <br> <br>
            
            I enjoy and I embrace to help and share <br>
            To friends and strangers both here and there, <br>
            I embrace cooperation, around the world and in every nation <br>
            I respect others rights and I hope for brotherhood and care. <br> <br>
            
            I believe culture and the arts have great value <br>
            And I believe that together we all can do, <br>
            I care not for worries or strife, but I care for the planet and all of its life <br>
            Yes, I woke just in time to help you.
